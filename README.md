## Login Form
Welcome to the Login Form project! This C++ application provides a simple login system where users can enter their credentials to access a secure system or application. With the Login Form, users can authenticate themselves by entering their username and password, providing a secure way to protect sensitive information and restrict access to authorized users only.

## Features
1. **Username and Password Input:** Allows users to enter their username and password into the login form.

2. **Authentication:** Verifies the entered credentials against a predefined list of usernames and passwords to determine whether access should be granted or denied.

3. **Error Handling:** Provides error messages and prompts users to re-enter their credentials in case of invalid input or authentication failure.

## Usage
To use the Login Form application, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Program:** Compile the C++ source code files using a C++ compiler such as g++. For example:

g++ login_form.cpp -o login_form

2. **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled program to launch the login form:

./login_form

3. **Enter Credentials:** Enter your username and password into the login form as prompted.

4. **Authenticate:** Press the enter key or submit button to authenticate your credentials.

5. **Access Granted:** If the entered credentials are correct, access will be granted, and you will be logged into the system or application. Otherwise, you may be prompted to re-enter your credentials or receive an error message indicating authentication failure.

## Customization
1. **Authentication Mechanism:** Customize the authentication mechanism to suit your specific requirements, such as integrating with a database, LDAP server, or authentication service.

2. **User Interface:** Modify the user interface of the login form to enhance the user experience or align with your application's design guidelines.

3. **Error Handling:** Implement additional error handling and validation logic to improve security and prevent unauthorized access.
